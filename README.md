# How to Useï¼Ÿ
This project is based on Python3 framework, using bootstrap and flask to build the front-end and back-end. For Database, we select Mysql(version 5.7). The Database GUI is Navicat, which can run the SQL script and help us not to use command line. The requirement.txtx will upload after the first domo.
