Week1: 
In the first week, we formed a team and created jira and github. Our group met at the weekend and read the descriptions of the six projects together.

week2:
I carefully studied the description of FilmFinders, and summarized and divided the functions of the project. I have an email discussion with Iwan for the confused function.
